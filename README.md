# Sickle-cell-prediction
the data set we working on is a virgin dataset from Uganda.
the samples were picked from Kumi Hospital and Soroti Regional Refferal hospital in Uganda.
140 people provided their blood samples which were processed using two methods . field stains and leichein stains . their microscopic images were captured and are hereby presented.
the dataset has 422 positive(sickle cell) images stored in Two folders . the folder labeled contains the positive images with bounding boxes around the seen sickel cells.
the folder Unlabelled are the positive images unlabelled(open to others to identify the sickle cells they see.)
the dataset has 147 negative images stored in the folder "clear" .
